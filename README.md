# Flying Menu

This project was inspired on a linkedin post from [SuryaKant Borad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suryakant-borad-085361240?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAADvaUSUBtg3w6iu4S3aSauDjigA37HyFZ_c&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BDZdPN6kpTQefe8GxJEuaxA%3D%3D) where he created a similar animation, seen that I also wanted to experiment and give it a try on my own.
